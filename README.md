## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [SASS/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS with superpower
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive Web Design

### What I learned

Im still quite new using SASS, while I'm building this project I came across an article about [SCSS styleguides](https://sass-guidelin.es/). Reading this article, I leared a bunch of things to make my scss files more managable and readable for my self and also for others. I tried to implement some of the guides to this project like the [7-1 pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern), tho this project is quite small and only has one(1) page so I only have 3 scss folders(base/helpers/layouts). This really help me a lot managing scss files and I'm preaty happy with the result.
